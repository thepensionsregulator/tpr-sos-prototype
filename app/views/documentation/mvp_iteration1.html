        This page is a public record of our designs and it tells the story of what we’ve designed and why for MVP1. The updates published below describe the development of new features to address user needs or changes in the legislation, iterations of existing features, or findings from user research. 
        -->
       This documentation is for the research conducted between <b>9th - 12th April</b> with internal users </p>

    <p class="govuk-body" > We tested the end to end journey, allowing the users to upload statement of strategy, supporting documents and selecting if they are in deficit or not. Below is a list of pain points for users and a potential way forward to solve the issue. </p>
