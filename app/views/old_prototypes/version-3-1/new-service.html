<p>We'll ask you for the effective date of the most recent scheme funding (Part 3) valuation of the scheme. If it's after 1 October 2023 then you'll need to use the new service to submit your valuation summary, and we'll give you instructions on how to do that.</p>

<p>If it's before 1 October 2023 then you'll be able to use Exchange to submit your valuation summary the same way you have before.</p>
